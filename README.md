# About this branch
This branch is heavily focused on stable code that works consistently,
even at the expense of extra CPU or Memory usage.

Currently the main differences in this branch are:
* Creating and closing browsers entirely instead of reusing a single browser
  * When using Firefox, this forces Firefox to re-download DRM plugins
